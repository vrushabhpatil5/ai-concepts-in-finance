# Generative AI in Finance – Initial Notes

Generative AI is increasingly used in finance to support tasks such as
financial analysis, reporting, scenario generation, and decision support.

Rather than replacing financial judgement, these tools act as
augmentation layers that improve speed and consistency.

## Key Use Cases
- Drafting financial reports and summaries
- Assisting valuation modelling and scenario analysis
- Automating documentation and reconciliations
- Supporting research and market analysis

## Key Risks
- Hallucinated outputs
- Over-reliance without validation
- Data privacy and confidentiality
- Explainability and regulatory concerns

## Reflection
The value of generative AI in finance depends less on model sophistication
and more on governance, controls, and human oversight.
